# React Chuck Norris Jokes App

After running `npm i` the app should automatically run and launch on http://localhost:9000

You'll need to login in order to get access to the joke application. You'll only need to enter text that matches the following criteria:

- Cannot be longer than 32 characters
- Can only contain lower case alphabetic characters
- Must include one increasing straight of at least three letters (e.g. "mno")
- May not contain the letters "i", "O", or "l"
- Must contain at least two non-overlapping pairs of letters (e.g. "aa")

An example of a valid password is `abcddee`
